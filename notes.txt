Earlier the server used to give the entire html page as its response. This resulted in constant reloading of the page and higher datarates.
Now we use webservices that is based on lazy loading.
The webpages become more fast and responsive.
One type of web services is REST. REST can be put,post ,delete, get etc
In this type of service the server first sends only the basic skeleton of the web page and after that depending on api calls other components are created or updated.
The web servoces connect to web page only for the api calls and disconnects after the response
The responses from the server are in JSON format 
fetch requests and axios
